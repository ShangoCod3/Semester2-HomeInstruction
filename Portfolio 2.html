      <h2>Homeschool Philosophy</h2>
      <p>Our homeschool is a journey I share with my dad, built on trust, hard work, and growth. We believe learning should make me a strong thinker, a skillful creator, and a good man. We follow our own pace and interests, focusing on understanding and using knowledge, not just memorizing facts.</p>

          <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/me/progress" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a>. My dad is a math teacher so of course he is my primary resource.
          We have moved on to completing multi-step equations and finding the value of variables. We also have started to learn about the distributive property, and Iâ€™ve done a couple of worksheets on it.

      <h4>ELA</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We aim to build reading, writing, and critical thinking skills for ELA. I have been given the room to be creative and express myself while we explore different kinds of books and texts, both fiction and non-fiction.
          We have worked on identifying literary devices and using them. We also have started to learn about different types of sentences such as declarative, imperative, interrogative, and exclamatory.
