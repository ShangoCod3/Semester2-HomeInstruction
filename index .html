          I am a basketball player, so I have to work out and run a lot. I play games almost every Saturday or Sunday and practice throughout the week. I do workouts including push-ups, planks, lunges, ab exercises, squats, wall sits, and sprints.

      <h2>Social Studies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In social studies, I’ve done a couple of packets on the Black Death and how it impacted Europe and Asia in the mid-1300s. I’ve also learned about the Bill of Rights and memorized the 10 amendments. I am now learning about separation of powers—what their main functions are, the extent of their power, and how they work together.

        <li>
         Music is really a free subject for me I listen to multiple
		 artist like kendrick lamar, j.cole, lil baby and etc.I dont 
		 really know the difference between hip-hop rap and drill 
		 I just like the music I listen to when i went to jamaica i listended to my playlist on spotify non-stop. I listened to it in the house, on the car rides, and even on the plane, music is how i relax and just decompress sometimes., or it can even get me hyped up and in a good mood
