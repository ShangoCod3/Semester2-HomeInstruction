          I am a basketball player, so I have to work out and run a lot. I play games almost every Saturday or Sunday and practice throughout the week. I do workouts including push-ups, planks, lunges, ab exercises, squats, wall sits, and sprints.

      <h2>Social Studies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In social studies, I’ve done a couple of packets on the Black Death and how it impacted Europe and Asia in the mid-1300s. I’ve also learned about the Bill of Rights and memorized the 10 amendments. I am now learning about separation of powers—what their main functions are, the extent of their power, and how they work together.
