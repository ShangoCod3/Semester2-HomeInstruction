      <h2>Homeschool Philosophy</h2>
      <p>Our homeschool is a journey I share with my dad, built on trust, hard work, and growth. We believe learning should make me a strong thinker, a skillful creator, and a good man. We follow a structured path that challenges me to think deeply, build real-world skills, and meet high personal standards, while leaving space for curiosity and real conversations. With my dad as my mentor, Iâ€™m learning to think wisely, act confidently, and grow stronger every day.</p>

      <h4>Mathematics</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <li> My dad is a Math teacher so he is my primary resource. He has put a whiteboard on our wall in the dining room (which is now our " classroom" and uses that to teach his lessons. We have completed a lot of <a href= "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rz9Nvt_7Xsq1nl-pBGCHtfsK6v_og5oD?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">worksheets</a>.
          </li>
          I still use <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/me/progress" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a>. I wanted to add screenshots of work I have completed on Khan Academy but my computer recently broke and I no longer have access to my Khan academy account. I will have to start a new one.

      <h4>ELA</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We aim to build reading, writing, and critical thinking skills for ELA. I have been given the room to be creative and express myself while we explore different kinds of books and texts, which helps me understand and analyze what I read. 
          We have worked on identifying literary devices and using them. We also have started to learn about different types of sentences such as declarative, imperative, interrogative and exclamatory.
