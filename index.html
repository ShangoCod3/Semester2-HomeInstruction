      <h2>Homeschool Philosophy</h2>
      <p>Our homeschool is a journey I share with my dad, built on trust, hard work, and growth. We believe learning should make me a strong thinker, a skillful creator, and a good man. We follow a structured path that challenges me to think deeply, build real-world skills, and meet high personal standards, while leaving space for curiosity and real conversations. With my dad as my mentor, Iâ€™m learning to think wisely, act confidently, and grow stronger every day.</p>

      <h4>Mathematics</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>My dad is a Math teacher so he is my primary resource. He has put a whiteboard on our wall in the dining room (which is now our " classroom") and uses that to teach his lessons. We have completed a lot of <a href= "https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMmc5LBVs17bZNZ1feFnkaMztyv6PiF2PxGskaQ7Eir6sLKEgGysncxc1g7JRoTGg" target="_blank">worksheets</a>.
          </li>
       <li>I still use <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/me/progress" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a>. I wanted to add screenshots of work I have completed on Khan Academy but my computer recently broke and I no longer have access to my Khan academy account. I will have to start a new one.</li>

      <h4>ELA</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We aim to build reading, writing, and critical thinking skills for ELA. I have been given the room to be creative and express myself while we explore different kinds of books and texts, which helps me understand and analyze what I read. 
          We have worked on identifying literary devices and using them, and how to create subtext by usig the different literary devices.
          You can see some worksheets that I have done <a href = "https://photos.app.goo.gl/tiEUv5Xikbn2fDqT9" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong>.</a> </li>
        
        <li> I recently visited Jamacia - which was amazing- and had to create a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/twKfe5hNEWuLd7wG7"     target="_blank"><strong>travel journal</strong></a> to document my experience while I was there.
          Since I have returned from the trip I have been <a href= "https://photos.app.goo.gl/RNFPtRq13JpR5ga78" target="_blank">reviewing the responses</a> to the prompts in the journal worksheet to make them more engaging and appealing. I have making corrections to grammar and checking for proper sentence contstruction and trying to improve on my use of literay devices.
