      <h2>Homeschool Philosophy</h2>
      <p>Our homeschool is a journey I share with my dad, built on trust, hard work, and growth. We believe learning should make me a strong thinker, a skillful creator, and a good man. We follow a structured path that challenges me to think deeply, build real-world skills, and meet high personal standards, while leaving space for curiosity and real conversations. With my dad as my mentor, I’m learning to think wisely, act confidently, and grow stronger every day.</p>

      <h4>Mathematics</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I still use 
          <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/me/progress" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a>. My dad is a math teacher so of course he is my primary resource.
          We have moved on to completing multi-step equations and finding the value of variables. We also have started to learn about the distributive property, and I’ve done a couple of worksheets on order of operations.We also read this book from time to time about mathematics,"A survey of mathematics with apllications".

      <h4>ELA</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We aim to build reading, writing, and critical thinking skills for ELA. I have been given the room to be creative and express myself while we explore different kinds of books and texts, which helps me understand and analyze what I read.
          We have worked on identifying literary devices and using them. We also have started to learn about different types of sentences such as declarative, imperative, interrogative and exclamatory
